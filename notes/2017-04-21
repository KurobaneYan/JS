it's better to use native js

location hash

JQuery based on Sizzle
cache DOM selection
chaining .end()

it will be faster to detach elements when you want to delete everything
or empty to dispose of the element's innerHtml

JQuery selector returns wrapper, which are not equal to each other
$ prefix is used to indicates that you are working with wrapper, not a DOM element
